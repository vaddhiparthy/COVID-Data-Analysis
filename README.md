# COVID Data Analysis

The project presents an analysis of the COVID-19 situation in the United States, with data meticulously sourced from the most reliable sources available up until March 2022. The project's objective is to provide a comprehensive and accurate portrayal of the pandemic, utilizing a wide range of metrics that are commonly referenced in public discussions about the COVID-19 situation.

By utilizing cutting-edge data visualization and statistical techniques, the project provides a detailed examination of the various factors impacting the COVID-19 situation, such as case numbers, death rates, vaccine distribution, and more. This in-depth analysis allows for a nuanced understanding of the pandemic, enabling informed decision-making for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the general public alike.

The project's ambition is to provide an unparalleled level of transparency and accessibility to the data related to COVID-19, by leveraging the most advanced technology and data analytics methodologies available.

The Project is an effort to assist the general public, policymakers, and healthcare professionals to make educated decisions to mitigate the spread of the virus and to have a deeper understanding of the pandemic situation. Its ultimate goal is to aid in managing the pandemic and save lives.

The results are visualizations of various metrics and statistical analysis results when considering their interdependencies and variation along the time axis. The ARIMA model tuning and analysis of the error metrics have pointed toward increasing the data resolution from weekly to daily data points which resulted in an accurate ARIMA model.
